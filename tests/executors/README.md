# Executor Testing Summary

## Features Implemented & Tested

1. **Base Executor Interface**
   - Submit task functionality
   - Map function over iterables
   - Shutdown capability
   - Context manager support (with statement)

2. **Thread Executor (for I/O-bound tasks)**
   - Based on Python's `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`
   - Good for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., network requests, file operations)
   - Non-blocking execution with simple API

3. **Process Executor (for CPU-bound tasks)**
   - Based on Python's `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`
   - Bypasses GIL for true parallelism
   - Good for CPU-bound tasks (computations, data processing)
   - Handles picklable functions and arguments

4. **Gevent Executor (for high-concurrency I/O tasks)**
   - Based on gevent's lightweight greenlets
   - Excellent for highly concurrent I/O operations
   - Compatible API with Future-like interface
   - Warning system for missing monkey patching

5. **Executor Factory**
   - Unified access through `get_executor(kind='thread|process|gevent')`
   - Consistent interface regardless of backend
   - Error handling for invalid executor types

## Test Coverage

- **Basic functionality**: submit, result retrieval, map operations
- **Error handling**: proper error propagation
- **Context manager**: support for with-statement usage
- **Task-specific tests**:
  - I/O-bound task performance for ThreadExecutor and GeventExecutor
  - CPU-bound task performance for ProcessExecutor
- **Factory pattern**: correct instantiation of requested executor types

## Notes

- The gevent tests include a warning check for monkey patching
- ProcessExecutor tests verify correct operation but don't strictly assert performance gains
- All executors implement a consistent interface for user code to remain unchanged

## Usage Example

```python
from taskflow import get_executor

# Choose the appropriate executor based on your workload
with get_executor('thread') as executor:  # or 'process', 'gevent'
    # Submit tasks
    future = executor.submit(my_task, arg1, arg2)
    result = future.result()
    
    # Or map a function over data
    results = list(executor.map(my_function, my_data))
```
